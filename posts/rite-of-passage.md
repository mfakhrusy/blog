How many times do I have to create a new blogging platform?

This question keeps popping out in my mind as I keep trying to make a new one.

I really want to have a safe place to write, to pour, and to express all of my thoughts into a single, centralized place.

I'm probably going to write something... unorthodox here... I just want to have a safe place to write, but I know very well that there's no such thing as freedom of speech, so I'm going to keep this relatively professional. I'm just going to assume someone from my workplace will read this, so it's not my actual, unfiltered though, it's just something that I feel safe enough to share!

Firstly, I have tried to create a blog multiple times with these approaches:

- Using nextJS site. This was when I started my job I think, or somewhere along the line when I still feel reactJS/nextJS/frontend framework is the correct way to write a website, combined with a static markdown files
- Using another programming language that combines both frontend and backend like Ruby (Rails), Elixir (Phoenix)
- Creating a blog from scratch using C. I have a server using C in this repo, but serving dynamic HTML is tiring and exhausting! So I lost interest
- In the past, I also have created a blog using static site generator like Jekyll, I think this is when I started doing programming work

In the ended up just using plain old HTML, CSS, and maybe some JS if I need some interactivity. I quite literally hand-write this blog post in HTML, it feels refreshing. I don't need any build system, I don't need any markdown parser, I don't need any complicated deployment process. I can just, write, and upload the files somewhere. It's freeing.
