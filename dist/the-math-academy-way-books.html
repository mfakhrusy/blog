<p>This book is fascinating!</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LLZK_34Oer9LwuqAv-pqxfXlR8n7V8zJ_MO323R7egI/edit?usp=sharing">Read it here</a></p>
<p>I&#39;m currently trying to skim the book, and it have some interesting techniques that I can apply to my learning process.</p>
<p>In the FAQ section, there&#39;s a term called &quot;Interleaving&quot;. The book should also contains the definition of it, but since I&#39;m currently skimming, I just went to the FAQ first to see the general idea of this book first, and this &quot;interleaving&quot; method caught my attention. Interleaving is a way to mix subjects and topics when you&#39;re learning something. For example, instead of focusing one unit or one theme problems at a time, we should mix different kind of problems in a single study session</p>
<p>Why? Exactly</p>
<p>This seems unintuitive at first, but the reasoning seems to be that it helps with retention because we force our brains to do different kinds of tasks at the same time, so our brain will work even harder in retrieving the relevant knowledge to solve all the different problems. This is fascinating!</p>
<p>Maybe the most obvious &quot;speciment&quot; to try this is to my kiddo? Well, I&#39;m a student too, so maybe I can implement this? Let&#39;s say I&#39;m taking a Reinforcement Class, how would this interleaving method works in my case?</p>
<p>Or maybe, we can do it a little bit further. I can study two subjects at the same time. For example: Electronics and Reinforcement Learning. Sounds bizarre, but I&#39;m also in the process of learning electronics by myself from scratch, and I need to learn RL for my school. Can I try to combine it? Let&#39;s find out in the next couple of months!</p>
